# DuckDuckGoogle
an extremely simple manifest v2 firefox extension that searches your duckduckgo search query on google with one click of a button. useful for instances where duckduckgo can't find what you are looking for.

the reason why im doing manifest v2 is because i use librewolf and i want to do background script, which librewolf doesnt allow by default. this could theoretically be implemented for manifest v3 properly with librewolf support and potentially be ported to other browsers but i cant be arsed to do it lmao.
